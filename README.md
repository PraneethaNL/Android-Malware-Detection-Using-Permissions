# Android-Malware-Detection-Using-Permissions
 In This permissions are used as features to detect malware in android using machine learning techniques.
 1.To extract permissios from the apk files ANDROGUARD is used(a.get_permissions() command).
 2.Created a matrix(dataset) using the unique permissions as features and the apk(both benign and malware) files on the y-axis,the dataset is in 0s and 1s i.e., if a particular permission is present in the apk then it's value is 1 else 0.
3.Feature selection is done using BGA,BPSO,CUCKOO Search algorithms, then SVM ,OneClassSVM is used for classifying.
4. The ROC curves are plotted , precision,recall & accuracy is calculated and based on these results the more suitable technique is decided.
